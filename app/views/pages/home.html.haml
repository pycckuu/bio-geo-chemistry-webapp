        The MyLake model has been developed at

        within various projects, and is freely available, but comes with no warranty under

        MyLake consists of a set of model code files, and has no graphical user interface. The model applications are controlled via

        scripts written specifically for each application.

        %h5 Stand-Alone Sediments
        Sediments is a biogeochemical model, which calculates the concentration of different species at each depth for a specific time period, based on the reaction framework, transport processes, and boundary conditions specified by the users. It does so by forming a system of partial differential equations based on the early diagenesis equation

        The new approaches account for the Gibbs energy of reaction of the potential redox processes and simulates TEA consumption based on the actual conditions in the system. That is, energetically less favorable oxidants are outcompeted by more favorable ones
