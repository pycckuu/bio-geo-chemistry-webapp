        #body-project{align: "justify"}
          Sediments is a biogeochemical model, which calculates the concentration of different species at each depth for a specific time period, based on the reaction framework, transport processes, and boundary conditions specified by the users. It does so by forming a system of partial differential equations based on the early diagenesis equation

          Using an approach based on the optimization of the power generated by catabolic processes allows one to account for dynamic environmental conditions (e.g., variability of temperature, pH, ionic strength, activities of redox active species). The method can be applied to simulate the redox stratification observed in early diagenesis and other energy-limited environments, such as oligotrophic aquifers, where energy substrates are in low abundance.
